% Generates the randomization file for the TOUCH experiment
% Experiment consist in a free-viewing task of complext scenes in the 
% meanwhile tactile stimulation is delivered on the hands. 
% Stimulations occurs in two
% different moments, ~150 ms after image appearance and randomly
% thereafter. Hands can be crossed or uncrossed

% The experiment is divided in 4 big blocks according to position of hands, big block
% are composed of smaller 20 continuous images blocs and 
% are intermixed and balanced across subjects in relation to the start condition 
% Hands block
% 0 - uncrossed
% 1 - crossed

% Stimulation conditions to be randomized
% stimulationa at image start occurs only in half of the trials, 
% 0 - no stimulation (half trials)
% 1 - left stimulation (1/6 trials)
% 2 - right stimulation (1/6 trials)
% 3 - bilateral stimulation (1/6 trials)

% Randomization of images, after 24 subjects an image should have happened
% in the four different start conditions at the specified ratio, two different block types
% Stimuli and mirror or original version, images from the typical osna dataset 256 images, plus 128 images
% from the labelme set
clear all
n_coh = 5;     %number of groups of 24 subjecs
n_block =16;    % number of block per experiment, every 4 blocks we change hands position


% we need to remove the images that have text because that makes teh
% mirroring evident.
