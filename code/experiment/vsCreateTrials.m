function vsTrials = vsCreateTrials(initDur, Nreps)
% vsTrials = vsCreateTrials() creates randomized trials for visual search.
% They are used by vsRunTrials.m to draw stimuli and control flow.
% The fields of vsTrials are declared general enough to only be filled with
% content (e.g. subject responses); no new fields should be defined later.
